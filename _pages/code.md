## [Image Reconstruction Attacks in Distributed Deep Learning Systems using Autoencoders](https://github.com/piyushnags/reconstruction)
Distributed Deep Learning Systems leverage IoT devices and Edge Computing to effectively process data and implement large Deep Learning models at scale.
In this work, I present an Image Reconstruction Attack on Distributed Deep Learning Systems for Computer Vision tasks using Autoencoders...

## [A Novel Approach to Wallpaper Group Classification using Continual Learning](https://github.com/piyushnags/wallpaper-clf)
This project aims to study if Continual Learning can be leveraged to forget biases while learning non-local and abstract features from 2D Wallpaper Groups.
