Hey there! I'm Piyush, a graduate student at Penn State. I study Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI). My research is primarily based on Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Privacy. I build AI solutions that are tailored to real-world use cases with an emphasis on computational efficiency and real-time scenarios. Currently, I'm developing real-time privacy-preserving Computer Vision models as part of my independent research. I proactively seek opportunities to broaden my skill set and collaborate with folks from other sub-disciplines of AI and Computer Science. At present, I'm working with the NLP Research Group at Penn State on the Amazon Alexa Taskbot challenge and I've gained an in-depth knowledge of multimodal Deep Learning models and datasets.

Recently, I've taken an interest in Continual Learning (CL) and I have dabbled in research projects using CL frameworks like Avalanche. I believe that CL can be used to effectively implement cutting-edge research ideas as viable, production-grade solutions in situations in which training data and/or resources are limited. As part of my future work, I would like to explore how CL can be used to improve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Vision-Language models. You can find my research projects and other relevant ideas that I've developed on this website.

In my free time, I like to read fiction books and skateboard.
