Hey there! I'm Piyush, a graduate student at Penn State. I study Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI). My research is primarily based on Machine Learning and Privacy. I build AI solutions tailored toward real-world use cases with an emphasis on computational efficiency and real-time scenarios. Currently, I'm developing privacy-preserving solutions for Generative AI applications in the Computer Vision domain. I proactively seek opportunities to broaden my skill set and collaborate with folks from other sub-disciplines of AI and Computer Science. In 2023, I had a great experience building muti-modal solutions for the Penn State NLP Research Group. As such, I enjoy deep-diving into unfamiliar territory and pushing my problem-solving skills to the limit. 

In my free time, I like to (voraciously) read fiction books and skateboard.
